This app is a versatile file management tool designed to simplify and secure file handling tasks, featuring three primary functionalities. The **File Organizer** script (`organize.sh`) helps maintain a clean and structured directory by automatically sorting files into folders based on their extensions, making it ideal for decluttering and improving accessibility. The **File Encryptor** script (`file_encryptor.sh`) ensures the security of sensitive information by encrypting files with a password and allows for easy decryption when access is needed. Finally, the **Date-Based File Deletion** script (`date_delete.sh`) aids in storage maintenance by identifying and removing files that haven't been accessed or modified since a specified date. This app is compatible with Unix-based systems, requiring basic tools like Bash, `find`, `mv`, and `openssl`. To get started, download the scripts, ensure they have executable permissions using `chmod +x`, and run the desired functionality through the terminal. In order to run these files together, you can pipe then as following; ./date_delete.sh | file_encryptor.sh | organize.sh.
